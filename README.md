# Git Command Reference Guide

---

Terminology used:
`origin`: the default name git gives to the remote repository you cloned from (origin = <https://github.com/>...)

`tracked`: when `git add` is used

`staged`: when `git commit` is used

How to write good commits:
When applied, this commit with \_\_\_.
If it makes sense then its good

## 1. Repository Initialization

### 1.1 Initialize Repository

**Command:** `git init`

**Parameters:**

- `--initial-branch`: sets the initial branch in a newly created repository

**Description:**

Creates an empty git repository - basically a `.git` directory with sub-directories.

---

## 2. Basic Operations

### 2.1 Check Status

**Command:** `git status`

**Parameters:** _NONE_

**Description:**

Shows the difference between the staged area and working directory (the HEAD commit and the index file)

**Use Case:**

See modified, staged, and untracked files.

### 2.2 View Changes

**Command:** `git diff`

**Parameters:**

- _NONE_
- `-w` ignore the white spacce

**Description:**

Compared the changes made in your working directory to the staged directory.

**Use Case:**

Whats changed but not staged?

### 2.3 Status of changes

**Command:** `git status`

**Parameters:**

- `--staged` or `--cached` is staged changes that have not yet been committed.

**Description:**

Git status shows you both the unstaged changes and staged changes compared to the remote.

**Use Case:**

Whats staged but not committed?

---

## 3. Staging and Committing

### 3.1 Stage Files

**Command:** `git add <file>`

**Parameters:**

- `-p` / `--patch` hunks specific code to add them to the index. Gives you a chance to review the difference before adding modified contents to the index.

**Description:**

Adds files to be staged.

### 3.2 Commit Changes

**Command:** `git commit`

**Parameters:**

- _NONE_ an interactive environment, allows for setting long-descriptions by using an empty space
- `-m "<message>"` adds a message describing the commit
- `-a "<message>"` does a `git add .` and provides an interactive environment.
- `-am "<message>"` just like above but also does a `git add .`
- `-p` exactly like `git add -p` just remember not to do a `git add` before
- `--amend` allows you to edit commit message, and adds the most recent changes to your latest commit

**Description:**

Commits staged files and records a snapshot of the project.

A git commit should only be selective and include relevant changes

**Use Case:**

Saving a stable point, to revert back to in the future.

### 3.3 View Commit History

**Command:** `git log`

Managing branches in a repository

Long-running branches are branches that have been in the complete life-cycle. You mirror this structure (used for releasing code)

Short-lived branches for new features, bug fix and refactoring

### 4.2 Switch Branches

**Command:** `git checkout`

**Parameters:**

`<hash | commit id>` checkout to a specific hash

```

### 5.3 Pull Changes

**Command:** `git pull`

**Parameters:**

`<origin> <branch>`
`--rebase` solve merge conflicts, meaning git will first pull changes, then reapply your unpushed commits on top of the latest version of the remote branch (no need to merge).

Acts exactly like fetch but also merges (or rebase) the two repositories

### 5.4 Push Changes

**Command:** `git push`

**Parameters:**

`<origin> <branch>`
`--set-upstream` / `-u` flags a local branch to a remote branch. (acts more as a setting option, set it once and forget about it, it links your `branch` to the `origin/branch`)
`--tags` push all the tags

**Description:**

Uploads the local repository with the staged changes to the remote

---

## 6. Integrating Changes

### 6.1 Merge Branches

**Command:** `git merge`

**Parameters:**

`<branch>` specifies the branch to merge from
`--no-ff` forces git to act like a pull request, when your merging a local branch into another local branch

**Description:**

Combines two branches into one

**Use Case:**

Merge is additive meaning history is preserved.

### 6.2 Rebase

**Command:** `git rebase`

**Parameters:**

`<branch>` specifies the branch to rebase from``
`-i` provides an interactive setup for rebasing

**Description:**

Reapplies commits on top of another branch.

**Use Case:**

Clean up local commit history. Rebase is reconstructive meaning history is rewritten.

### 6.3 Cherry-pick

**Command:** `git cherry-pick`

`<commit-hash>` the hash of the commit you want to cherry pick

`<hash1> <hash2> <hash3>` / `A..B` for selecting multiple hashes

**Description:**

**Use Case:**

When you've mistakenly committed to the wrong branch you use cherry-pick to revert.

## 7. Undoing Changes

### 7.1 Reset

**Command:** `git reset`

**Parameters:**

Resets branch to a specific commit

**Use Case:**

You committed too early or made a typo in the message.

### 7.2 Revert

**Command:** `git revert`

---

## 10. Recovery and History

**Command:** `git submodule`

**Parameters:**

**Description:**

A git repository inside another git repository.

FYI: when others clone your repo they should also initialize your submodules with `submodule init` or `clone --recurse-submodules`

Also submodules track commits and not branches (meaning when you clone a repository it goes to the exact commit at where the submodules was added, yet in web based github it opts to look at the default branch)

**Use Case:**

When wanting to use other repositories in your current repository you can have it set as a submodule

---
